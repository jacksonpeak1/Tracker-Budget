## Description

This was the homework assignment. for unit 18 on PWA's. Overall I really enjoyed working with PWA's on this project. It was also really great to get an opportuntiy to learn more about and practice with manifests and service workers. Finally I also really enjoyed implementing the aspect of caching into coding, and I look forward to the future and how I can implement all these developer tools!
